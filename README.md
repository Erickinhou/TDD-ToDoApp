## Description

This a project base to understand how TDD works.
The basic idea is try to implement the test first and after this implement the code.

## TDD Steps

- Step 1: Write your tests and they gonna fail (red)
- Step 2: Write your code until the test passing (green)
- Step 3: Refactor, improve the code, and even write more test from that.
  Repeat that circle until eventually have a fully implemented application :)
